Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Courseera. 

I took this course to learn the core of Machine Learning. The course is really helpful for a beginner and gives a way to step into this field.

There are exercises in the course which i have completed and uploaded here.

The solutions are not for anyone to copy but for na reference for somone who is stuck while completing them.

I have also upoaded some witeboarding and personal notes which might help you along the way.
